# Home Work Handwriting Machine

This DIY Arduino-based handwriting machine automatically writes text on paper, simulating human handwriting. This project uses CNC Shield with A4988 stepper drivers for X and Y axis motion and a servo motor for pen up/down control on the Z-axis. The system interprets G-code commands to reproduce text, drawings, or signatures accurately on paper, making it perfect for learning about CNC motion control, robotics, and automation.

## Working Principle

1. Load the G-code file (generated from a text or drawing) into a G-code sender.
2. The Arduino Uno, loaded with G-code interpreter firmware, reads the commands.
3. Stepper motors move the pen along the X and Y axes according to the G-code path.
4. The servo motor lifts and drops the pen to mimic handwriting.

## Software Setup

* Firmware: Arduino G-code interpreter (like GRBL or custom code for G-code runner)
* G-code Generator: [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) with G-code extension or online text-to-G-code converters
* G-code Sender: Universal G-code Sender (UGS) or Python-based G-code runner


## Circuit Overview

* X-axis stepper → CNC Shield X driver (A4988)
* Y-axis stepper → CNC Shield Y driver (A4988)
* Servo (Z-axis) → CNC Shield servo pin (D11 by default)
* Power Supply → 12V DC input to CNC Shield
